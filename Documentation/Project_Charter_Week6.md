Prepared by: Chaz Torres<br>
Version: 0.0.3<br>
## 2. Project Purpose & Background
We have an ongoing issue with the current sign in solution to for the tutoring labs on campus. We are working to make an improved sign in solution. We are wanting to be able to track all students as well as have a data collection to analyze student needs.
## 3. Objectives & Goals
* Primary Goal(s):
* Secondary Goal(s):
## 4. Scope
### In Scope: 
A working sign in form that stores data in a database.
 
### Out of Scope: 
Sign out / Admin logging / data visualization 
## 5. Stakeholders & Roles
Project Sponsor:<br>
Project Manager:<br>
Development Team:<br>
Security/Compliance Officer:<br>
Other Roles:<br>
## 6. High-Level Requirements
* System must allow students to sign in/out.
* Data must be stored securely.
* Reports must be exportable or viewable for analysis.
* Must be simple and user-friendly.
* User deployable with simple maintainability.
* Runs efficiently.
## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
* Limited development time (one semester).
* All work must be stored in GitHub.
* Use open-source tools where possible.
* Assume access to lab computers and campus network.
* Limited PHP/React Experience.
## 8. Security Considerations (SecDevOps Focus)
* Authentication/authorization needs?
* Data privacy concerns (student IDs, PII)?
* Access control for reports?
* Compliance with FERPA or college data guidelines?
## 9. Risks & Mitigation
* Risk: Students don't sign in -> Mitigation: Make interface quick/simple.
* Risk: Data loss -> Mitigation: Backup in GitHub / database redundancy.
* Risk: Security gaps -> Mitigation: Regular security checks by Security role.
## 10. Success Criteria
* Working prototype deployed in lab.
* Accurate and secure collection of sign-in data.
* Reports support data-driven tutor scheduling.
## 11. Timeline / Milestones
* Week 2: Planning & Charter Approval
* Week 3-4: Initial Prototype (basic sign-in form)
* Week 5-6: Database integration
* Week 7-8: Security & Testing
* Week 9-10: Final Deployment & Demo
